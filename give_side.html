  <h3>A short experience about my traveling.</h3>
  <p>I often go outside. One day during cycling, I saw a bus was coming towards me. 
   I was surprised that then I had to take side but I didn't try to do so though I was
   very conscious. I became surprised that the bus reduced its speed and went beside me
   after I passed the narrow place. I was thinking that the road is nerrow and for being
   most of the time almost empty the long route's bus stay with very high speed around
   150+ km/h. I thought that, when two this kind of long route's bus cross each other
   with high speed then accident can happen seriously. But the nice thing is knowing
   everything well and being conscious about what I do or this kind of matter can make
   anyone happy for a moment of time.
